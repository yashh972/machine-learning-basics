This project demonstrates the basics of Linear Regression, one of the most fundamental algorithms in Machine Learning. It shows how a simple model can learn the relationship between independent and dependent variables to make predictions.

🧩 Features

Implements Linear Regression from scratch and using scikit-learn

Includes data visualization using matplotlib

Predicts outcomes based on trained models
